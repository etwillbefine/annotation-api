# Built in HTTP-Server
This module comes up with its own HTTP-Server. Its flat and fast.
But you are not able to use some awesome features of express (Coming soon?).

### About
Accepts only json or x-www-url encoded requests.
Also this server just provides fixed routes.

### Benchmark
Benchmark-Screen (the upper one uses express):  
[here](/sample/benchmark.png)  

__Note:__ Normally there is a average load between 35 and 50 milliseconds for our test route. 
It might could be a little bit faster, if you test it on your server.
