### Node.js routing with express, using annotations

This module allows you, to define your routes with annotations instead of using nested callbacks and exports.
It also provides a validator, to automatically validate incoming requests.

## Annotations
[See all annotations](/doc/annotations.md)

## Create a Route

## Configuration

You can also define the name of our annotations there.
